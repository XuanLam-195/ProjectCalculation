# ProjectCalculation Tool

## A fully minimalistic planning tool for projects of all sizes

This project has been carried out by two programming students as part of their second semester examinations. The project was realized in collaboration with our educational institution (KÃ¸benhavns Erhvers Akademi) and Alpha Solutions. We've developed a planning tool that allows companies to structure their projects and break them down into smaller components. The purpose of this project is to create a planning tool that is simple, quick, and intuitive to use, and isn't burdened with unnecessary features.

Some of the highlights of our program is:

* Role system to deefaault are ADMINISTRATOR and EMPLOYEE.
* Intuitive design and "helping text" to clarify what inputs is legal.
* Build-in safety features in front-end to make sure users cant input illegal inputs.
* Fail-safe options, that will take user to login if and unexpected error happens.
